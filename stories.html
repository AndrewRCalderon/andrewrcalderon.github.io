            <p>We were lucky for Visuals to be involved early enough in this project that we were able to help shape the format of the narrative. We wanted to provide users with a base level of knowledge about the conflict in Georgia before immersing them in each individual’s experience.</p>

In one of the graphics, we mapped school funding by district using MapboxGL.js and included story text specific to the user’s location.</p>

            <p>Analyzing election results by looking at counties that flipped from one party to another. A developer and a data reporter on the team stitched together current and previous election results along with demographic information, and I worked with the team to sketch out these charts and then design and build them. The maps were originally drawn in D3, but I chose to present them as flat images to keep the page and the flipper animation as lightweight as possible.</p>

            <p>I worked on a short turnaround with a small team of developers and designers to create NPR’s live fact-checking rig for annotated event transcripts. Among the challenges was implementing live-updating content within a responsive iframe in order to better integrate the transcript within the CMS.</p>
