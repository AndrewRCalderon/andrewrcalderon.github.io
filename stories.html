          <h3>Paroled People Can Vote in Colorado. Why Did Forms Say They Couldn’t?</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          For this story about Colorado's three-year delay in updating voter registration forms to 
          correctly show that people on parole are eligible to vote, Ilica Mahajan, Alex Arriaga, Weihua Li from The Marshall Project, and I,
          analyzed voter registration and parolee records, finding that at most 27% formerly incarverated people eligible to vote had registered since a 2019 bill restored that right while on parole.
          In light of our inquiries, the Colorado State Secretary updated the forms prior to publication.

        </a>
        <p>
          For this story about Texas Governor Greg Abbott's multi-billion dollar Operation Lone Star, 
          Keri Blakinger from The Marshall Project and I teamed up with Lomi Kriel and Perla Trevizo from ProPublica/Texas Tribune. 
          Over the course of 9 months, we found that despite Abbot's claims of success, the operation was based on shifting and questionable metrics, 
          leaving more questions than answers about its accomplishments.

          For this story about felony disenfranchisement, I worked with Nicole Lewis to join state voting records with prison release records to
          identify how many people recently released from prison appeared in their state's voter rolls.
          I designed and built the scrolling visualization, an SMS campaign to reach the formerly incarcerated with a
          survey 
          and I analyzed, cleaned and manipulated all the data for the story.

          For this story about migrant deaths along the border, Isabela Diaz from MotherJones and I used Department of Homeland Security data to
          determine the death and rescue rates along the border.
          I reported out the story, helped write it, found and analyzed the data and built
          the visualization. I worked with designers and a photo editor on the visual treatment for the story. I also
          made the
          graphics embeddable on MotherJones' website, and collaborated with the Spanish-language translators to publish
          the story on Television's website.

          For this story about abused, neglected or abandoned migrant kids stuck in legal limbo, I worked with illustrator Julia Kuo on the visual treatment,
          including the flowchart and header image. I reported out the story and wrote it. I designed and built the data visualizations.
          I also negotiated a data agreement with researchers who
          shared their data with us for the state block.

        <p>For this story about the economic burden on tax payers of putting migrants through detention proceedings,
          Julia Preston and I worked with a research institute to use Census data to calculate the number of families
          with at
          least one undocumented breadwinner that would fall into poverty if that person were deported. I vetted the
          Census analysis, designed and built

          I worked alongside Emily Kassie to report out the data for this story, which involved pouring over archival records in Washington D.C.,

          until an actor was found. Along the way, I provided feedback on the story structure.

          who collect cans and bottles for income. I wrote and reported the Canning FAQ section, doing original data collection and analysis to
          elucidate a shady system that preys on a vulnerable population of most elderly immigrants of color. This work ultimately became my thesis.
